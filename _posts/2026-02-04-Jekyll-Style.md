In this lab, I worked on customizing the look and structure of my Jekyll blog by modifying layouts, adding navigation pages, and writing custom CSS. This lab helped me understand how templates and styling work together in a static site.

## What was new to me

Some of the newer concepts in this lab included:

- Editing Jekyll layout files like post.html to rearrange content such as the title, date, and author  
- Understanding how navigation links are generated automatically from root pages  
- Using SCSS in style.scss instead of regular CSS  

It was interesting to see how small changes in layout files can completely change how posts are displayed.

## What I struggled with

The biggest challenges were:

- Figuring out which CSS classes Minima actually uses so my styles would apply correctly  
- Remembering how picky YAML and SCSS formatting can be  
- Making sure the layout changes didn’t break how posts rendered  

Once I matched my CSS to the theme’s structure, everything started making a lot more sense.

## What still doesn’t fully make sense (yet)

I’m still learning:

- How themes organize large SCSS files and imports  
- How much styling should go in layout files versus the stylesheet  
- How more advanced Jekyll themes structure reusable components  

I think this will become clearer as I keep customizing the site.

## What I’m looking forward to

I’m excited to:

- Keep improving the visual design of the blog  
- Add more pages and posts over the semester  
- Learn more advanced layout techniques  

Overall, this lab made the site feel more like a real personal project instead of a default template.
